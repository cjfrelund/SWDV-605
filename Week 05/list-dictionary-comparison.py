# list-dictionary-comparison.py
#     A simple program that compares a list with a dictionary.
# by: Charles Frelund

# A list uses brackets while a dictionary uses curly brackets...in python.
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
myDictionary = {"One": 1, "Two":2, "Three":3, "Four":4, "Five":5}

print(myList[3])
print(myDictionary["Two"])


# items in a list are unordered and are placed into a list at an index location.
